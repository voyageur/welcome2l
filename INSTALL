Welcome2L - Welcome to Linux, ANSI login logo for Linux
=======================================================


NOTE:
=====
Because "A 'welcome' page has been proven to be an invitation 
to come your system, thus making it legal to hack into your box." 
you may want to use the "-private" arg when running Welcome2L
to display an "Unauthorized access is prohibited" line at the bottom 
of the ANSI screen. 



INSTALLATION
=============


STEP #1 : Building Welcome2L
----------------------------
( Only required if you have the source distribution.
  If you got the binary distribution you can jump to step #2)


To build Welcome2L:
`cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type:
% make

This will start the compilation process. Note that gcc may report some
warnings. Don't worry about them. Only worry if gcc returns an error code.

At this step you can verify that a Welcome2L excutable have been created 
by typing :
% ls

You can even launch it by typing :
% ./Welcome2L

NOTE: running it in a xterm will not give you the real ANSI picture.


STEP #2 : Installing Welcome2L
------------------------------

type :
% make install
(This will copy Welcome2L to /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L)

or you can manually copy Welcome2L to /usr/local/bin
and chmod it 0755 :
% chmod 0755 Welcome2L


STEP #3 : running Welcome2L
---------------------------

ON REDHAT SYSTEM:
=================
The best place to run Welcome2L is IMHO in rc.local :
- cd to /etc/rc.d/
- edit rc.local
- near the end find these lines (may be not exactly the same) :
    echo "" > /etc/issue
    echo "Red Hat Linux $R" >> /etc/issue
    echo "Kernel $(uname -r) on $a $(uname -m)" >> /etc/issue
- comment them out
- add this one (change the version numbers to yours) :
    /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L -msg"Red Hat 5.0 (Hurricane)" -getty> /etc/issue
- to obtain something like that:
    #echo "" > /etc/issue
    #echo "Red Hat Linux $R" >> /etc/issue
    #echo "Kernel $(uname -r) on $a $(uname -m)" >> /etc/issue
    /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L -msg"Red Hat 5.0 (Hurricane)" -getty> /etc/issue


ON DEBIAN SYSTEM:
=================
[ From: Gerd Bavendiek <bav@rw.sni.de> ]

  > I put a script in
  > lulu:/etc/rc.boot> ls
  > 0setserial  1netenv     2hdparm  3Welcome2L
  >  
  >  It's contents is just
  >  
  > #!/bin/sh
  >  /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L -getty -msg"Debian GNU/Linux 2.0" > /etc/issue


ON SLACKWARE SYSTEM:
=======================
[ From: Elisa  <entropika@usa.net> ]
  
 Well, I'm using Slackare 3.6 and in order to make a custom version of
 the /etc/issue, I should comment out
 the following lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.S (not rc.M!):

echo > /etc/issue
echo Welcome to Linux `/bin/uname -a | /bin/cut -d\  -f3`. >> /etc/issue
echo >> /etc/issue
echo "`/bin/uname -a | /bin/cut -d\  -f1,3`." > /etc/motd

At first, I suggest to comment these out... then add the two lines :

 /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L > /etc/issue
 /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L > /etc/issue.net


ON SUSE 6.0 SYSTEM:
===================
[ From: Ronny Ziegler <ronny.ziegler@usa.net> ]

>  You should have an error-free bootprocess before installing Welcome2L.
>
>   1) Add the following in your /sbin/init.d/rc file as
>      the line before last (that´s the one with exit 0)
>          /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L
>      where this is the path to your Welcome2L-executeable
>
>   1b)Optional: If you dont´t like Welcome2L to overwrite your
>      boot-messages, add
>          echo -e \\v\\v\\v\\v\\v\\v
>      (or some more \\v ´s) in you rc before starting Welcome2L.
>
>   2) Now you don´t need the old Login-Text any more:
>      mv /etc/issue /etc/issue.orig
>      touch /etc/issue
>
>  That´s all. Now you can continue playing NetTrek. ;-)


ON SUSE 6.1 SYSTEM:
===================
[ From: Robert M. Taylor <rmtaylor@bellatlantic.net> ]

> follow the instructions for 6.0 but have Welcome2L overwrite the /etc/issue file as below:
> /usr/local/bin/Welcome2L -msg"SuSE Linux 6.1" -cpu"Cyrix 6x86MX" > /etc/issue


 
USING THE -xmasauto OPTION:
===========================
[ From Kevin (Barthel) Knerr <ld_barthel@usa.net> ]
 
> No matter which distribution you use, the -xmasauto option is
> useless if you only run Welcome2L from a boot-time rc file --unless
> you boot your system every day. What you really want to do is to
> update /etc/issue daily without rebooting.  Here's how:
>
>    1) Edit your boot-time rc file to use Welcome2L as per
>       the directions for your distribution above. E.g.:
>
> /usr/local/bin/welcome2l -xmasauto -getty -msg"Slackware Linux 3.2" -cpu"Cyrix 6x86L" >/etc/issue
>
>       Note: The -cpu option is one of my personal modifications to
>       Welcome2L.
>
>    2) Create an entry in root's crontab file to rewrite
>       /etc/issue every day. E.g.:
>
> # Update /etc/issue with Welcome2L (ensures -xmasauto works!)
> 0 4 * * * exec /usr/local/bin/welcome2l -xmasauto -getty -msg"Slackware Linux 3.2" -cpu"Cyrix 6x86L" >/etc/issue
>
>       Note: I update at 4am because I work 3rd shift and login after work.
>
> If you haven't worked with (Dillon's) crontab before, do the following:
>    a) login as or su to root (if you su, cd to root's home first)
>    b) crontab -l >crontab.ori
>    c) cp crontab.ori crontab
>    d) edit crontab, add your new crontab entry, and save
>    e) crontab crontab
> This will ensure that you don't lose any default crontab entries from
> your distribution.
