v1.01 16-OCT-98
---------------

- Added a -getty switch. You are encouraged
  to use it when invoking W2L in rc.local
  Will give you more accurate information.
  [Thanks to Donald (Don) Molnar <molnar@gmx.de>

  a summary of color numbers. Useful for
  some argument like -lcolxx (see below)

  color. Usage is -lcolxx where xx is the color 
  number. In example, -lcol14 will  set
  the login prompt color to yellow.
  
- Nodemane longer than 15 characters are now
  truncated to their first part (i. e.
