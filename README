NOTE:
=====
Because "A 'welcome' page has been proven to be an invitation 
to come your system, thus making it legal to hack into your box." 
you may want to use the "-private" arg when running Welcome2L
to display an "Unauthorized access is prohibited" line at the bottom 
of the ANSI screen.

Description
===========
Welcome2L is a little program that may run at login time to produce a BBS
like ANSI login logo. It's very similar to Linux_Logo. But where Linux_Logo
intends to be portable, Welcome2L intends to produce the best looking
ANSI screens by making full usage of PC graphic characters. Therefore
an architecture able to display those characters (i386, Alpha with TGA adapter,
... ) is required to use it. And, even if it will work on larger screens,
it will only produce 80 column ANSI screens. 



AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO READ THE INSTALL FILE ...
