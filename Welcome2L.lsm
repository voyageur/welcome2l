Version:	3.04
Entered-date:	28JUN99
Description:	Welcome2L is a little program that may run at login time
		to produce a BBS like ANSI login logo. It's very similar 
		to Linux_Logo. But where Linux_Logo intends to be portable
		Welcome2L intends to produce the best looking ANSI screens
		by making full usage of PC graphic characters. Therefore 
		an architecture able to display those characters
		(i386, Alpha with TGA adapter,... ) is required to use it. 
		And, even if it will work on larger screens,
		it will only produce 80 column ANSI screens.
